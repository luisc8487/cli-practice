# Command Line Interface - Practice

### Directory Set-Up
1. Type `pwd` to see my workspace directory.
2. For my practice, we will  b ecreating folders and files using only the command line. Determine where I want to create them and `cd` to that folder.
3. Created the following directory structure:
```
cli-practice/
|
|-----my_family/
|
|-----my_fellows/
|      |
|      |---codenation/
|      |    |--carmen.md
|      |    |--devnote.txt
|      |    |--enmanuel.md
|      |
|      |---music/
|            |--anne.txt
|            |--kirk.txt
